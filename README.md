# smol-tui-rs

A tui framework aimed for embedded devices (no stdlib, zero allocations).

Docs are TBD, examples can be found in `examples/` directory. The most interesting one is probably the `multi_scene`, which aims to demonstrate more or less complete app, though not all ideas are presented there (TBD).
